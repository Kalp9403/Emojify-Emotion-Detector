# Emojify: The Emotion Detector 🧐

Welcome to **Emojify: The Emotion Detector**! This project is all about understanding emotions. It's a powerful tool that uses a pre-trained model to predict the emotion of a face. 

## About the Model 🧠

The model is trained on the **FER-2013 Dataset** and has achieved an accuracy of **73%**. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, a class of deep learning neural networks, which has proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification.

## How it Works 🛠️

The model works by extracting faces from an input image using **OpenCV**, a library used for real-time computer vision. Once the faces are extracted, the model then predicts the emotion for each face.

## Emotions Detected 😄😠😢😮😨😐

The model can detect various emotions, making it versatile and adaptable for different use cases. Whether you're building a mood tracker, a feedback system, or an interactive art installation, this emotion detector can add a new level of interactivity and understanding.

## Getting Started 🚀

By doing this project, I learned basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts. You'll also need to install some dependencies, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

I really enjoyed using **Emojify: The Emotion Detector** and find it useful in my other projects!
